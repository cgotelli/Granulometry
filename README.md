# Granulometry


This git contains the necessary files to get the Grain Size Distribution of a sample of particles from images.

The code was tested with images taken with the Dino-lite USB Microscope available in the Laboratory en Environmental Hydraulics. However, it should be easily generalized to work with images coming from different devices. In any case, the functions are commented to make easier any modification if needed.
