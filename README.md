This folder contains the necessary files to get the Grain Size Distribution of a sample of particles on images.

The sample images were taken with the Dino-lite USB Microscope available at LHE. However, it should be general enough to work with images from different origins. In any case, the functions are commented to make easier any modification if needed.
